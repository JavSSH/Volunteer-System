### Sample Data Included

**Categories (100 volunteer opportunity types)**
- Located in: `database/mock-data/category.sql`
- Contains 100 diverse volunteer categories including Elderly Care, Food Distribution, Youth Programs, etc.
- All categories include names, descriptions, and active/inactive status flags

**User Accounts (100 distinct user accounts)**
- Located in: `database/mock-data/user.sql`
- Pre-configured test accounts for all user roles (see Default User Credentials section)
- Includes sample data for names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, and account statuses

**User Profiles (4 distinct user profiles/types)**
- Located in: `database/mock-data/userprofile.sql`
- Links users to their respective roles (User Admin, Platform Manager, CSR Rep, PIN)
- Includes profile descriptions and role assignments

**Requests (100 volunteer service requests)**
- Located in: `database/mock-data/request.sql`
- Contains requests from PIN (Person In Need) users seeking volunteer assistance
- Each request includes:
  - PIN user who created the request
  - Optional CSR Rep assigned to handle the request
  - Associated volunteer category
  - Status (0 = uncompleted, 1 = completed)
  - Request date ranging from January to July 2025
  - View count (number of times the request was viewed)
  - Shortlist count (number of times the request was saved to shortlists)
- Covers diverse scenarios: some requests are assigned to CSR Reps, others are unassigned
- Request statuses vary between completed and in-progress

**Shortlists (30 saved requests)**
- Located in: `database/mock-data/shortlist.sql`
- Represents CSR Representatives' saved/bookmarked requests for follow-up
- Each shortlist entry links a specific CSR Rep user to a request they've marked for attention
- Contains shortlists from 10 different CSR Rep users (user IDs: 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 30, 33)
- Each CSR Rep has shortlisted 3 different requests
- Enforces uniqueness constraint to prevent duplicate shortlisting of the same request by the same user
- Useful for testing CSR workflow features like task management and request tracking
